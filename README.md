# GSoC_2019_Red_Hen_Lab
This repo. will contain my project with Red Hen Lab during this summer 2019
I am going to participate in two projects 
First one will be OCR :
OCR is a very wide application which translates characters in the image to an editable format. OCR on television news shows would recognize any text appear on a screen and translate this text to editable formate at one-second intervals. During OCR development some challenges appear, one of these challenges is to detect duplication if text repeats in successive frames, the application will handle this case. Another challenge is to see if it is time to make space between words or not (i.e. space detection) as the output may be all words concatenated together and space some times not detectable in frames. My work will be based on CNN and BLSTM VS open source libraries the best accuracy will be deployed. The project will be deployed on HPC machines using Singularity containers.

Second project will be also done an enhancement on ASR (Automatic speech recognition) which is done last year by Ahmed Ismail. This project will be trained on a new dataset and new modification to the architecture may be done (if required ) to increase it is accuracy.
